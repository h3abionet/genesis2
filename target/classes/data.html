<h1>Data input format</h1>
<p>Genesis requires two input files and an optional third file as explained below</p>

<ol>
    <li>An admixture file which contains on each line the estimated ancestral proportions of
        each individual. Typically, this would be produced by a program like Admixture (e.g,
        and admixture Q file), or CLUMPP, the output formats of which Genesis supports
        natively. For example, an Admixture Q file for K=4 contains four columns. Provided
        the input is a legal format, Genesis will automatically work out what input file it is,
        and what the K value is. Instructions on using the structure2CLUMPP script which
        can be used for Structure input files is described later.</li>

    <li>A plink-style fam file. The first two columns must uniquely identify the individuals
        (the first column is usually the family identifier, the second the individual identifier).
        See the plink manual for further description. The j-th line of this fam file describes the
        j-th individual in the admixture file. This all that Genesis requires, although fam files
        typically have other columns as well.</li>

    <li>Optionally, a phenotype file: again, the first two columns identify the individual, and
        subsequent columns label the individuals (e.g., case/control, male/female, population
        group, language, etc). The individual identifiers should be the same as in the fam file:
        each individual in the fam file should also be in the phenotype file, but there is no
        problem in having individuals in the phenotype file who are not in the fam file. The
        order of entries in the phenotype file need not be the same as in the fam file. You could
        use the same file as the fam and the phenotype file.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Advice on data formats</h1>
<p>Eigenstrat is directly supported by the Genesis.</p>

<h3>SNPRelate</h3>
<p>The SNPRelate R package of Zheng et al [2012] can be used to do PC-analysis. However,
    since it is an R-package there is no SNPRelate default format since output is fully programmable
    in R. We support the following output: a file that contains the eigenvalues,
    followed by the eigenvectors, produced using the following R commands.</p>

<div class="code">
<code>pca <- snpgdsPCA(genofile,snp.id=snpset) <br>
    write.table(pca$eigenval,"pca.rel",sep="\t",quote=FALSE) <br>
    tab1 <- data.frame(sample.id = pca$sample.id, <br>
    pop = factor(pop_code)[match(pca$sample.id, sample.id)], <br>
    EV1 = pca$eigenvect[,1],<br>
    EV2 = pca$eigenvect[,2],<br>
    EV3 = pca$eigenvect[,3],<br>
    EV4 = pca$eigenvect[,4],<br>
    EV5 = pca$eigenvect[,5],<br>
    EV6 = pca$eigenvect[,6],<br>
    EV7 = pca$eigenvect[,7],<br>
    EV8 = pca$eigenvect[,8],<br>
    EV9 = pca$eigenvect[,9],<br>
    EV10 = pca$eigenvect[,10],<br>
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)<br>
    write.table(tab1,"pca.rel",sep="\t",quote=FALSE,append=TRUE)</code>
</div>

<h3>flashpca</h3>
<p>FlashPCA is designed to perform PCA on very large data set. It takes as input a plink
    BED and BIM file and produces eigenvectors or principal components. We have a script
    <em>flashpca2evec</em> which converts the data into a format that Genesis can read. Because the
    flashpca output has no information about the sample IDs, <em>flashpca2evec</em> also needs the fam
    file as input. This script requires Python 2.7.</p>

<p>By default, flashpca calls its output files <em>eigenvalues.txt</em> and <em>eigenvectors.txt</em> and this is
        (by default) what flash2pca expects. For example:</p>

<code class="code">flashpca2evec --fam data.fam --out data.evec</code>

<p>However, if the files have other names, the appropriate flags can be used</p>
<code class="code">flashpca2evec --fam data.fam --eigenval file1.evals --eigenvec sample.csv --out data.evec</code>

<h3>plink2evec</h3>
<p>PLINK 2 [Purcell and Chang 2014] (and its alpha release plink 1.9) supports PCA directly.
    Genesis can handle these files natively but assumes that the default plink's default naming
    convention is used (e.g., a <em>.eigenvec</em> suffix). If this is not followed, Genesis will not be able
    to recognise the file type. Thus plink2evec is bundled for that purpose. <em>plink2evec</em> converts the plink
    output files into the format that Genesis can read.</p>

<p>By default PLINK calls its output files <em>plink.eigenval</em> and <em>plink.eigenvec</em> and this is (by
    default) what <em>plink2evec</em> expects. For exmaple:</p>

<code class="code">plink2evec --out result.pca.evec</code>

<p>However, if the files have other names, the appropriate flags can be used</p>

<code class="code">plink2evec --eigenval file1.evals --eigenvec sample.csv --out data.evec</code>

<p>And if as is common in plink usage, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues file was specified by
    using the plink <em>--out</em> flag, then plink2evec can use its <em>--bfile</em> flag</p>

<code class="code">plink --bfile sample --pca --out sample</code>
<code class="code">plink2evec --bfile sample --out sample.pca.evec</code>
