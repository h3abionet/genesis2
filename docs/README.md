#Documentation for building on other platforms

JAR files for MacOS, Windows and Linux are available. This section provides instructions for other platforms

A build on another platform should work, subject to checking that the right dependences for JavaFX libraries are used. The way the project is set up, Maven should automatically find them.


## Conifguration concerns
To run the version that does not include dependences on the command line, you need to download a version of the [JavaFX SDK](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

Assuming the JavaFX library is in directory named in shell variable `$JAVAFX` and your JAR file is in `$JARF`, you can invoke it as follows:

    java --module-path $JAVAFX --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.swing -jar $JARF

*Note*: the library path should go to the actual contents so if e.g. the path is `/usr/local/lib/JavaFX/lib` then include the trailing part of the path after `/lib`. In my examples, the libraries are not in another layer of `lib` directory as this is implied by the rest of the path.

There is a Bash script `genesis.sh` in this repository (in `scripts`) that can run the above. To invoke, create environment variables that the script will use (it has defaults if you donâ€™t do this). To the the above effect (modifying the paths to suit your install):

    export JAVAFX=/usr/local/lib/JavaFX-21
    export JARF=$HOME/Applications/Genesis2-2.4b-Generic.jar

Note: in Unix shell scripting, you can create a shell variable wuthout using the word `EXPORT` but the value will not be visible to a child process, i.e., the script will not see it. The JavaFX path should contain the actual library files -- if they are in a directory called `lib` append that to the path.

## Building on different environemts


* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you don't have it already; there are versions for all Unix platforms (including Mac) and Windows
* On the command line (assuming you want this branch), run `git clone -b Philip https://github.com/h3abionet/genesis2.git`
* Install [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (21 is tested; earlier versions may work) -- make sure you get the right version for your platform
  * For a Mac, you want the DMG installer for ARM (if your machine is an M1, M2, M3, etc, model, x64 otherwise)
  * For Linux, whether you want a DEB or RPM depends on the Linux distribution (also there are options for both ARM and x86; for Linux x86 is more common)
  * For Windows, either the .exe or the MSI installer should work
* Install [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/index.html) ([version 18](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/nb18/) includes a Mac installer, though 19 can also run on all platforms)
* Install [SceneBuilder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) if you want to edit the user interface
* Open Netbeans, select Open Project and navigate to the place you downloaded using `git` -- the top-level directory (folder) should be called `genesis` and NetBeans will recognize this as a project
* Look for **Clean and Build** under the **Run** menu, or the clean and bulid icon (hammer and broom) and select either of them.
  * Look in the `target` directory (folder); you should find two JAR files:
     * the one with the name ending with `with-dependencies.jar` should be possible to launch from the file browser (Finder on a Mac)
     * the other JAR file does not include the JavaFX libraries and should be possible to launch from the command line using the  `genesis.sh` script (or a variation suitable for Windows)

## Test data
Data to test functionality is available in the repository in directory `agm-demo/agm-genesis/sample-data/` (Windows users can rotate the slashes to suit).

Data file types available to open are:

* `.g2f` -- a Genesis2 project (the first thing to open, unless you want to start from scratch); you can then use
  * `.eigenvec` -- PCA file
  * `.Q` -- Admixture file
    * when opening one of these, you are not restricted as to file type as there is no standard for admixture files
    * this will add another pane to graph the admixture plot
    * you can open more than one admixture file and there will be an additional plot for each
* If you start a new project instead, you need to add the following file types:
  * `.fam` -- a [FAM](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#fam) file
  * `.phe` -- phenotype file
  * You will also need to import a PCA file (`.eigenvec`) before anything is graphed
