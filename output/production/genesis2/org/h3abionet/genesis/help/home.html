<p>Genesis is a program created for scientists to generate PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and structure/admixture
    graphs from data outputted by common tools such as eigenstrat [Pritchard et al. 2000] and the SNPRelate [Zheng et al 2012]
    package for PCAs and Admixture [Alexander et al. 2009] and CLUMPP [Jakobsson and Rosenberg 2007] for admixtures.</p>

<p>Genesis was developed with user-friendliness in mind as other tools can be complex to use and lack certain features.
    All elements of the graphs that would need to be edited can be done so using a graphical user Interface where the graphs
    themselves are interactive and different elements can be viewed and changed at the click of the mouse. All this saves the
    time that scientists would rather be spending doing more important things.</p>

<p>Principal Component Analysis is a mathematical and statistical procedure that can be used to analyze genotype data.
    The differences between samples genotype data can be used to project each sample into a p-dimensional space, where
    the p axes are uncorrelated. For realistic data, typically p is 4 or less and often only the most important
    two dimensions are used. Programs such as eigenstrat produce the PCs, and Genesis produces them.
